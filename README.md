## About the app
Winpilot will pick up where Bloatynosy left off. The plan was originally just to rename the AI version, but this time we'll do it right and completely turn our backs on Bloatynosy. I've been playing around with a few names over the past few weeks, which are now making their way into Winpilot as plugins, such as CoTweaker and ClippySupreme, which also doubles as the main assistant in the Winpilot app designed as a chatbot. I might also introduce some classic Bloatynosy functions natively as "plugins". 




The latest release of Winpilot introduces a significant milestone with its hybrid web app foundation. 
This update not only empowers users with the capability to remove AI features in Windows but also emphasizes the app's intelligent approach, driven by a novel hybrid and web-based core.

Here are the individual plugins briefly explained:

- **CoTweaker**: It enhances Windows privacy settings and optimizes system and gaming configurations.
- **Decrapify**: It removes unwanted apps and also handles advanced debloating.
- **WingetUI**: It offers some essential base apps for download.
- **Copilotless**: It searches for AI/Copilot features in Windows and allows you to remove them. Please follow the instructions provided.
- **Clippy**: This is the assistant you'll consistently see in the app, @Microsoft Clippit, also known as Clippy, the manic cousin of Microsoft Copilot, monitoring various areas of the system. It can also provide simple tips. Just keep clicking on the plugin to access them."
- **PimpApp (Extensions)**: A revamped collection of third-party scripts and plugins, including the iconic WinModder from Bloatynosy, now reborn as PimpApp. Originally conceived in 2020, PimpApp stirred debate with its bold name and ability to tweak systems with community templates. Now integrated into Winpilot, it offers advanced debloating and customization features. Explore plugins like RestoreInboxApps for easy application restoration and RemoveDefaultApps for swift system decluttering with a single click.

Winpilot can also be used to change various settings and access various pieces of system information.
