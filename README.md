Simply execute BloatynosyAI.exe. Feel free to delete the cache folder BloatynosyAI.exe.WebView2 whenever necessary.

With the chat box in front of you, input your search terms, inquiries, or keywords, and enjoy real-time results.

Additionally, using this search function, you can easily install popular apps using 'winget.'
