Windows 11 has a gazillion toggles and settings options. And general users donâ€™t know where to find most of these features, what to make of them, and which setting to enable or disable. **BloatyNosy** streamlines and houses all the essential settings under one app and allows you to disable and remove unnecessary features with just a simple click. 

It comes with a few modules that will be expanded over time, similar to [ThisIsWin11](https://github.com/builtbybel/ThisIsWin11). 
_BloatyNosy may also replace the [ThisIsWin11](https://github.com/builtbybel/ThisIsWin11) app sooner or later and serve as a universal app debloater._

- Via the link in the lower right corner **"I want to set up Windows 11 for the first time"**, you can call a **Windows 11 Setup/Assistant** and customize your system step by step and debloat it.
- You can skip the assistant and let the app module on the main page handle the analysis entirely. It will check and fix a tons of unnecessary components and creating a debloated Windows 11.
- It features a **BloatFinder app**, which allows you to remove pre-installed apps automatically or the manual way. 
- The **WinModder app** allows you to apply code snippets based on PowerShell and community scripts.
- Next to this the app installer **InstaPackage** is integrated, which allows you to install some of the most important apps with a click and in bulk.
